# === Theme ===
# You need to manually include the colors from your chosen theme.
# You can convert your Alacritty theme using a converter or manually paste from the converted version.

# === Environment ===
# Not directly supported in kitty config; use shell or wrapper script to set env vars if needed.

# === Window ===
# Padding (not directly supported in Kitty like in Alacritty; workaround using `margin` if needed)
# Kitty doesn't support fine-grained padding, but you can simulate some effects with these:
window_margin_width 10
window_margin_height 10

# Decorations
# Kitty does not support "Buttonless" decorations directly, but you can hide titlebar:
hide_window_decorations titlebar-only

# Opacity and Blur
background_opacity 0.7
# Blur must be handled at the compositor level (e.g., picom); Kitty doesnâ€™t support blur natively.

# Option as Alt key (macOS-specific)
# Kitty supports this via macos_option_as_alt
macos_option_as_alt both

# === Font ===
font_family MesloLGS Nerd Font Mono
font_size 17.0
